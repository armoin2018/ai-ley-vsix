   - When does the issue occur?
   - What are the environmental conditions?

2. **Context Gathering**:

   - Error messages and stack traces
   - User actions leading to the issue
   - System configuration and dependencies
   - Recent changes or deployments

3. **Issue Classification**:
   - Error type (runtime, logic, performance, integration)
   - Severity level (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Impact scope (single user, specific feature, system-wide)
   - Urgency level (immediate, scheduled, backlog)
```

### Phase 2: Investigation

```markdown
1. **Reproduction**:

   - Create minimal reproduction case
   - Identify consistent triggers
   - Document exact steps to reproduce

   - Check data validation and sanitization
   - Review database queries and results
   - Analyze API requests and responses
```

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis

```markdown
1. **Hypothesis Formation**:

   - Use debugging tools to inspect state
   - Document findings and evidence

3. **Cause Identification**:
   - Identify the fundamental root cause
   - Distinguish symptoms from causes
   - Map relationships between issues
   - Assess broader impact and implications

## 7. Debugging Strategies

### Systematic Approaches

```markdown
## Binary Search Debugging

1. Identify the range where bug occurs
2. Test the middle point
3. Narrow down to smaller ranges
4. Repeat until issue is isolated

## Rubber Duck Debugging

1. Explain the problem step by step
2. Walk through code line by line
3. Question each assumption
4. Often reveals issues during explanation

## Hypothesis-Driven Debugging

1. Form specific hypotheses about causes
2. Design tests to validate each hypothesis
3. Gather evidence systematically
4. Eliminate possibilities methodically

## Change Analysis Debugging

1. Identify when the bug was introduced
2. Review all changes since last working version
3. Test reverting specific changes
4. Isolate the problematic change
```

### Tool-Specific Techniques

- **Debugger Usage**: Breakpoints, step-through, variable inspection
- **Logging Strategies**: Strategic log placement, log level management
- **Testing Approaches**: Unit tests, integration tests, regression tests
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality tools, linting, type checking
- **Profiling Tools**: Performance analysis, memory usage tracking

## 8. Example Investigation Flows

### Example 1: NullPointerException Investigation

```
User: "Getting a NullPointerException in my Java application when processing user data"

Investigation Process:
## Error Analysis
- Exception: java.lang.NullPointerException at line 45 in UserProcessor.java
- Stack trace points to user.getName() call
- Occurs during batch user processing

## Reproduction
- Created test with null user object
- Confirmed exception occurs consistently
- Issue happens when database returns null user records

## Root Cause
- Database query returns null for deleted users
- Code assumes all returned records are valid user objects
- No null checking before calling methods on user object

## Solution
1. Add null checking before processing user objects
2. Handle deleted users gracefully in business logic
3. Update database query to filter out deleted users
4. Add unit tests for null user scenarios

## Prevention
- Implement defensive programming patterns
- Add validation layers for external data
- Create comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
```

### Example 2: Performance Degradation Investigation

```
User: "Application response time has increased significantly in production"

Investigation Process:
## Performance Analysis
- Response time increased from 200ms to 2000ms average
- Issue started after recent deployment
- Database query time is the primary bottleneck

## Code Analysis
- Recent changes added new WHERE clause to main query
- New clause references unindexed column
- Query execution plan shows full table scan

## Root Cause
- Missing database index on newly added filter column
- Large dataset causing full table scan
- No query performance testing in staging environment

## Solution
1. Create database index on filter column
2. Update query optimization and testing procedures
3. Implement query performance monitoring
4. Add database performance tests to CI/CD pipeline

## Prevention
- Mandatory query performance testing for database changes
- Database index analysis for new query patterns
- Performance monitoring alerts and dashboards
```
