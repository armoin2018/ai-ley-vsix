## Example Output

**Game Concept:** “Hive Wars” — players control insect colonies battling for resources.  
**Target Audience:** Families, ages 8+.  
**Platform:** Tabletop card/board hybrid.

**Components:**

- 92 hexagonal cards (insect units, resource tiles, queens).
- Dice (battle resolution, movement).
- Tokens (resources, damage).

**Setup:** Each player starts with a queen and 5 resource tiles. Shuffle deck.

**Gameplay Flow:**

- On your turn: draw a card → place or move a unit → resolve battles.
- Win by eliminating opponent’s queen or collecting 20 resources.

**Variations:**

1. **Fast Play:** Start with 3 queens each, game ends at first queen eliminated.
2. **Resource Rush:** First to 10 resources wins, no combat allowed.
3. **Team Mode:** 2v2 colonies sharing resources.

**Balance Notes:**

- Designed for 2–4 players.
- Average playtime 30–45 minutes.
- Encourages strategy and tactical adaptation.

**Next Steps:**

- Build paper prototype with index cards.
- Playtest combat dice balance (is attack too random?).
- Consider expansion pack: “Hive Wars — Predators & Parasites.”
