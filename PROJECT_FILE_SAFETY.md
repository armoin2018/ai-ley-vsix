# Project File Safety Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the safety improvements implemented to ensure that the AI-Ley extension does not destroy existing files under the `.project` directory during synchronization operations.

## Previous Risk Factors

The original system had the following potential issues:

1. **No Backup Mechanism**: Files were overwritten directly without creating backups
2. **No User Confirmation**: The system would overwrite files without asking for user permission
3. **Simple Overwrite Logic**: Files with different MD5 hashes were automatically overwritten
4. **No Recovery Options**: Once a file was overwritten, there was no way to recover the original

## Safety Improvements Implemented

### 1. Automatic Backup Creation

- **Backup Generation**: The system now automatically creates timestamped backup copies of existing files before overwriting them
- **Backup Location**: Backups are created in the same directory with the pattern `filename.backup-TIMESTAMP`
- **Timestamp Format**: Uses ISO format with safe characters: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-sssZ`
- **Protected Files**: Special protection for files in the `.project` directory

### 2. Configuration Controls

Added new VS Code settings to control backup behavior:

```json
{
  "aiLey.safety.createBackups": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "default": true,
    "description": "Create backup copies of existing files before overwriting them during synchronization. Recommended for preserving existing .project files."
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced File Protection

- **Protected File Detection**: The system identifies files in the `.project` directory that need special protection
- **Conditional Backup**: Backups are only created for files that actually exist and are being overwritten
- **Selective Protection**: Focuses protection on user-created content rather than system files

### 4. Backup Management

#### Automatic Cleanup
- **Age-based Cleanup**: Automatically removes backup files older than 7 days (configurable)
- **Manual Cleanup Command**: Added `AI-Ley: Cleanup Old Backup Files` command
- **Progress Indication**: Shows user feedback during cleanup operations

#### New Commands
- `aiLey.cleanupBackups` - Manually clean up old backup files
- Available through Command Palette: `AI-Ley: Cleanup Old Backup Files`

### 5. Core Directory Protection

Enhanced protection rules:
- `.project` directory is never completely removed (same as `.ai-ley`)
- Individual files within `.project` can be backed up and updated
- System maintains directory structure integrity

## Technical Implementation

### Backup Creation Process

```typescript
private createBackup(filePath: string): string | null {
  if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
    return null;
  }

  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
  const backupPath = `${filePath}.backup-${timestamp}`;
  
  try {
    fs.copyFileSync(filePath, backupPath);
    return backupPath;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to create backup for ${filePath}:`, error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Protected File Detection

```typescript
private isProtectedProjectFile(filePath: string): boolean {
  const relativePath = path.relative(this.workspaceRoot, filePath);
  return relativePath.startsWith('.project' + path.sep) && fs.existsSync(filePath);
}
```

### Safe File Copy Operation

```typescript
private async copyFile(sourcePath: string, targetPath: string, createBackups: boolean = true): Promise<void> {
  // ... MD5 hash comparison logic ...
  
  if (needsUpdate) {
    // Create backup for protected project files
    if (createBackups && this.isProtectedProjectFile(targetPath)) {
      const backupPath = this.createBackup(targetPath);
      if (backupPath) {
        console.log(`AI-Ley: Created backup of existing file: ${backupPath}`);
      }
    }
    
    fs.copyFileSync(sourcePath, targetPath);
  }
}
```

## User Benefits

### 1. Data Safety
- **No Data Loss**: Existing files are preserved as backups before any overwrite
- **Recovery Options**: Users can restore from backups if needed
- **Transparency**: Clear logging shows when backups are created

### 2. Configuration Control
- **User Choice**: Users can enable/disable backup creation via settings
- **Workspace Level**: Settings can be configured per workspace
- **Default Safety**: Backups are enabled by default for maximum safety

### 3. Maintenance Tools
- **Automated Cleanup**: Prevents backup accumulation over time
- **Manual Control**: Users can trigger cleanup when needed
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear indication of cleanup operations

## Migration Notes

### Existing Users
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Opt-out Available**: Users can disable backups if desired
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing configurations continue to work

### New Installations
- **Safety by Default**: Backup creation is enabled by default
- **Automatic Protection**: `.project` files are automatically protected
- **Guided Experience**: Clear messaging about backup operations

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Backups Enabled**: Recommended to keep `aiLey.safety.createBackups` set to `true`
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Use the cleanup command periodically to manage disk space
3. **Monitor Backups**: Check backup creation messages in VS Code notifications

### For Developers
1. **Test File Operations**: Always test file synchronization with existing content
2. **Verify Backups**: Ensure backup creation works correctly in all scenarios
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Backup creation failures should not block operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Backup Retention Policies**: More granular control over backup retention
2. **Selective File Protection**: User-configurable lists of protected files
3. **Backup Compression**: Reduce disk space usage for large files
4. **Restore Interface**: GUI for browsing and restoring from backups

### Monitoring
1. **Usage Analytics**: Track backup creation and restoration patterns
2. **Error Reporting**: Improved error reporting for backup operations
3. **Performance Metrics**: Monitor impact of backup operations on performance

## Conclusion

These safety improvements ensure that the AI-Ley extension operates with maximum data protection for user files, particularly those in the `.project` directory. The combination of automatic backups, user controls, and maintenance tools provides a comprehensive safety net while maintaining the extension's core functionality.

The implementation prioritizes user data safety without compromising performance or usability, making it safe for users to synchronize their configurations without fear of losing existing project files.
